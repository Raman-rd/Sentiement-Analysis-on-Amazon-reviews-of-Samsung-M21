Ravi Kumar,3.0,Serious hotspot issue.,"  When I start hotspot in this phone, and try to connect laptop to it, it fails. When I make hotspot with any other phone, my laptop connects instantly, but only with this phone's hotspot, it keeps on rotating the cursor, or says ""can't connect to this network"". I need urgent help with this otherwise I will have to get it replaced.",neg
Amazon Customer,5.0,Super Samsung Phone,  Here is my review on the new samsung m21.I'm using this smartphone from 2 months so I can give my comment to help you guys make up your decision. I categorise my review based on the following points: (a) Built Quality (b) Display (c) Camera (d) Performance (e) Software (f) Battery(A) Build quality: It's a nice looking phone with a standard build quality nothing fancy on the back. Plain standardised back side with glossy finish but very well built keeping in mind it has 6000 mah battery. It's feels quite light in hands. It's a sturdy phone and it can handle if it accidentally it drops sometime. If you want to get fully packed phone in this price range it's a good phone to buy with this build quality.(B) Display: We all know samsung make great displays so here also it's a 6.4 inch water drop notch mailed display which is amazing in this price range. I bought this phone only for its great display and cameras. I mostly watch videos on my phone and it's a great experience. Even the touch response is also very good in samsung phones. Amoled display and 6000 mah battery is a great combination.(C) Camera: Camera is it's highlight in this price range. Samsung captures very good photos with a good balance of colors and natural sharp photos. The colors in photos are not over saturated. It takes very good photos. M21 has 20 mp front cam and 48 mp back camera which takes amazing photos. Samsung live focus provide some amazing features. Samsung UI is brilliant providing u some amazing features in camera.(D) Performance: Samsung's performance is quite balanced with exynos 9611 series processor. I don't do much gaming but for occasional gaming it will not disappoint you but specifically for gaming you can check out some other products with better processors in this price range. But for day to day usage it performs good and samsung hi provides great performance with this processor. So you are getting a good camera bigger battery and sufficient powerful processor.(E) Software: Samsung UI is great no ads altogether and has great features which are really useful. You can check some videos on features for samsung UI. I like the Samsung standardised UI which is great easy to use and smooth.(F) Battery: For battery it's a 6000 mah battery so you can expect a 2 days battery life for normal user and 1 day full use for heavy users who do a lot of gaming movie and videos watching. But for battery you can give 7 star and samsung did a great work by keeping the phone light weigh also with this massive battery inbuilt. So it's a great phone in this price range. Fully packed samsung phone.,pos
Prashant,2.0,"Boycott China product, go for Indian/Non-Chinese.","  Samsung M21 is  Manufactured in India and even brand is from S.Korea.

Rohit warkade,5.0,Extraordinary and Pantagruelian in this price range,  Amazon deserves the innumerable accolades for delivering this phone in this maze of lockdown.

Dheeraj,5.0,far above my expectations,  the battery is too good and pubg works fine too.i reccomend not going for brands like mi realme and other chinese brandsbloatware free (adfree) one ui is even better than stock android. camera is fine too.Another thing is that dont go for the realme 6 or 6 pro for its 90 hz display because its ips lcd.amoled 60 hz is way better than that.,pos
Rachit Anjariya,5.0,Battery beast ...no compromises,  First time buying a Samsung phone and absolutely loved the experience.......the phone is 9/10 overall...The feel in the hand is really premium even with polycarbonate back...I've held glass phone and this phone doesn't feel any cheaper....Samsung didn't make any compromises with phone ...my only complain is the fingerprint scanner it takes a little swipe to unlock rather than a tap...I'm not quite used to this.....the performance in public is great too.  ...I reccomend gfx tool to achieve true 60 fps possible to GPU optimization in premium gfx tool ......the best thing about this phone is the battery ....... it's a beast and nothing can beat it in this price range....I get minimum of 8hrs of screen time in my heavy usage with the phone playing games and using social media apps.....its my new favourite phone...thx to samsung,pos
Vansh,5.0,"Battery is good , Camera is worst, screen is very good and bright, heating when u use while charging","  I was looking for a smartphone with good battery life for using it as hotspot, all other features were secondary for me. I am satisfied with the needs but I have to mention below thingsPros:Battery is good as per 5 days of usage with 30 + default google appsScreen is bright and very good to look atno lag for normal apps (im not a game fan) ConsWorst ever camera i used on a smartphone. 48MP is just the size of image, quality of what it captures is patchy and bad images. Camera quality compared to the advertisement is very bad.Heating issue when screen is on while charging.",neg
Luckveer N.,5.0,Experience of using m21,"  Perfect mobile phone with more storage space, Excellent sound quality with Dolby atmos ,extended battery life ..I tried to use full night to watch OTT web series.. morning 42% of battery life is pending.. if you keep volume less than 50% we can't hear any sound ..company should improve this .. we can't keep volume with 100% at all time... Inbuilt functionality of install 2 social apps like WhatsApp ,FB etc., my suggestion .. if you are looking for phone less 15000 with so many features. This is one of the best model to look:)",pos
wellwisher,3.0,Mic has problems,"  First when I got this phone I found it has issues with mic. Hence I placed a request for replacing the item. Second time also I faced the same issue. When I am the caller, the receiver is able to hear my voice clearly. But when I am the receiver, caller is not able to hear me properly. I need to talk louder in order to be audible. I returned the phone again. I would want Samsung to check this issue and work on it. Otherwise all the other features in this phone are value for money.",neg
Pugalenthi Palanisamy,5.0,Average phone,"  Biometrics is good i.e. fingerprint sensor and face recognition works very smooth. Phone performance is smooth , do not lag.But :-1. 6000mAh do not run for more than 24 hours in normal usage, no games, no music, song, just net crowsing over wifi.2. Camera is 48 MP but the sensors behind it make that 48mp pretty useless, the moment you zoom post taking 48mp photo (3:4) you will find out that it is not 48 mp, as pixel started splitting.3. Personally I did not like UI, so switched to Microsoft UI and that works smooth.",neg

Ravi Kumar,3.0,No return/refund for damaged product.,"  The phone doesn't even turned on and It's not getting charged also. Unfortunately there is no return or refund policy for this. If you want to return this item you have to install one smartchek app and diagnose the issue, otherwise Amazon will arrange an inspection service at your delivery address and you'll get a replacement only if the technician is convinced. Amazon is simply cheating it's customers. Never expected this kind of discourteous service from Amazon.",neg
abhishek mishra,3.0,"6GB 128GB, Good Battery good camera","  I got the delivery yesterday. My last phone was Poco F1. M21 is a good phone at this price point. as its a big battery with 15W charging capacity it will take anywhere between 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge but once charged it can easily go for 2 days for non-gamer. Camera is good at this price point.The best thing is its Samsung, which has good after service and if you take samsung care + home pickup and drop. for M21 2 years the price of care+ is Rs1349 with everything covered except theft",pos
Rupesh,1.0,"Good performance, efficient battery output, decent camera","  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a month. The box comes with M21 handset, Power adapter, USB cable and ejection pin. Earphones are not included in it. The battery performance is quite good, it takes not more than 2 hrs to charge completely from zero to 100% and on medium usage, can last upto 2 days. The phone handset is very light weight as compared to M10, M20 which is very heavy to carry because of heavy weight of battery. One good thing is that the M21 handset as well charger or power adapter is made in India. As of now, the overall performance is good, battery output is efficient though there is some heating of device during charging, only sometimes & not always. Camera quality is good too but in natural light settings. I need to use this phone for some more time to further write detailed updated review but at the end of the day, Samsung can be trusted for their phones.",pos
ZEYAN ABOOBACKER,4.0,Samsung Galaxy M21,"  Buying this product is a waste of money. The single phone cost is 15000 rupees but the quality and performance is very poor.

Ankit,5.0,Worth its price. Just about.,"  Previous generations of Samsung phones used to provide better quality though. This one provides excellent specs for the price, but doesn't come with earphones and its charging cable is very short. I have to use a USB extension cable to make up for that. Operation is real smooth and lots of space. Camera is okay, battery is great but that's the ""standard"" in the age of Mi. Fingerprint reader frequently fails. Lots of features I enjoyed in the older Galaxy J7-6 are missing though. Thankfully almost all my customizations are preserved thanks to Smart Switch. Still for a Samsung phone it has too much bloatware. Thankfully I am able to disable all of them. Guess that's why the low price, I'm content with it, with this RAM, storage and battery it'll make overall usage comfortable.",neg

Mukesh Kumar Thakur,2.0,Disappointment! Display causing headaches!!,"  Review after using 10 days..This Mobile has lot of issues..1. Network reception- This is really  lower than other mobiles..  There is low network  in my house but other mobiles work perfectly.. In this mobile, network i m getting is almost negligible..2. Battery Issue - company  claims  it to have 6000MH, but it drains too fast. I have compared with my 2 years old MI phone(4000mh). This phone drains little faster than mi. So what's the point of claiming  6000 mh3. Voice audio quality - quality  of the voice which you listen in your ear while talking to some is really bad like a cheaper phone's. Mostly  you need to be very attentive  to listen.4. Heating issue - And I have also read the reviews  that people are also having  heating  issues. Though  I don't have this issue still..",pos
Vighnesh Poojary,4.0,Got defective mobile,"  It is the worst mobile I ever had. Company claims saying Gorrilla glass 5 protection is not justified as its screen broken with a single slip while sitting in the chair from my jeans pocket. Further no one is there to listen. We feel so bad that in India where there is world's largest market of mobile consumers, still there is no best mobile which can compete these Chinese cheap and best mobiles. I love my India. So will wait....",neg
Amazon Customer,4.0,Samsung M21 4gb is not a good  product  to buy.,"  I have never been a fan of customized Android phones, and have mostly preferred phones with the stock Android. I was looking to a new phone because the manufacturer of my earlier phone did not support security updates that were required for my work apps / email.This is my second Samsung phone, after the 2010-launched Nexus S. Compared to earlier phones, this feels a little big and is heavier as well. Perhaps it could be due to the battery. So far, there is nothing to complain about, but I would have liked the price to be comparable to the Redmi models. I got this one for ~ Rs. 14K, which the seller claims is at a Rs. 2K discount. I wouldn't have bothered to pay Rs. 16K for sure. The Redmi Note 9 comes in at around Rs. 12K for similar configuration. I would have bought the Redmi phone, but the reviews made me feel suspicious about it (especially about the ads being displayed).Some stand out points:§ Made in India: I didn't have a constraint on this one, but hey, if it's made in India, then, why not.§ Selfie camera: Samsung says it us 20 MP. It is definitely better than other models I have been using. (Note: I almost always prefer phones below Rs. 15K)§ Android 10: This itself was my constraint. I was looking only for Android 10 phones. One of the most important things for me was the support for dark mode.§ Reputed manufacturer: Well, Samsung is the leader. So, can't go much wrong with this brand.§  Minor irritants:§§ The setup process feels as though using the Samsung's Smart Switch app is the only way to get data from your existing phone. If you do not want to use it, the setup wizard is slightly different than the stock Android version. If you have a backup of the previous Android phone on Google, that can be used as well. However, setup takes a long time as compared to the stock Android version.§§ The location of the back and recent app buttons on the navigation bar are swapped. I had to install a button remapper app to swap the 2 buttons.§§ Samsung tries to push its own apps and its account sign up. I avoided it like plague, and deleted all the unnecessary apps.§§ I prefer the Nova launcher app. I feel at home after installing this app.In short, after some customization, it was back to what I wanted.",pos

Cv Vineeth,4.0,Honest review,"  All of you guys know what are the plus points. Let me tell you the negative points-1. Camera is kind of ok ok, I have Realme 2 pro 16 mp sony sensor.. both are kind of same. But Samsung's hdr and dynamic range is superb.2. Battery not optimized. Maybe next update will fix this issue. Screen on time 8 to 9 hours. No gaming.3. Samsung running on February security patch. But my Realme 2 pro 1.5 year's old device running on latest security patch. Samsung's update policy is worst.4. Sometimes UI freezes just for 1 second. Not an issue of processor. UI needs more improvement.Hope it helps! Cheers!",neg
Ravi Kumar,3.0,Battery life and Performance,"  I was apprehensive about Samsung phones offered at this price but just to teach Chinese a lesson I opted for Samsung galaxy M 21 and it didn't dispoint me at all.Followings are pros and cons of this mobile1. ROM RAM are much much more .  I got more than 3gb of free RAM space and more than 115 gb of memory available.2. Camera and selfie camera are class apart and I felt that rich detailing coming back to pic which was lacking in Chinese mobiles.. "" camera quality - ⭐⭐⭐⭐""3. Huge 6000mAH battery is really long lasting.. one first full recharge it took 2 days to come to 30 level even with continuous uses. ""⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ For battery.4. Display is super rich. Can be easily distinguished from othe phones mostly Chinese.. ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5. Finger print reader is super fast ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.6. It's light weight and super amolded screen is eye catching ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.Easy to grip and premium looking.ConsSome common features are lacking which are otherwise given in most phonesNo net speed  indicators. I just downloaded one small app from store and now it's working fine.No option for zooming in when using 48 MP cameras.. however still shots are super rich..No screen guard, back cover provided with phone.Overall it's a gud buy at this price range..Samsung is trying to recapture its original lost out to Chinese filthy mobiles.. earlier it was not offering this much of features with less pricing. However after Noida plant Samsung is in no mood to spare Chinese mobile companies.Request to all my friends.. pls find one suitable phone from samsung or other indian companies as per ur requirement. However in absence of good phones from from india we can give Samsung a try. All price range and ROM and RAM options available. Pls go for Samsung phones",neg

rajeev tejapuriya,1.0,A perfect 😍Non-Chinese😍 phone in mid range,"  I got this device yesterday.Initial great impressions, sturdy phone a bit on the heavier edge because of the huge battery.I am rating a perfect 5 for the amazon packing and service provided.I am happy with the device, its pretty smooth with the new Samsung One UI, lot of great features and improvement on the older samsungsThis is the first time i have decided to buy a Samsung phone. I never bought them because i never liked Samsung's UI.So overall happy but a 3 star rating for the device because of the defect inside one of the camera lens i don't know how that happened. But i am not happy seeing it. I know this is a low-budget phone. But i do not expect such carelessness from samsung. I know its a small thing and i can still take photos but i don't feel good that it's there.I wanted this phone urgently, i have use for it. So i cannot even replace this phone because I need it. Once the lockdown is lifted i will have to visit the service center.Such a good device. But a small thing that ruins the experience Samsung. I don't know how quality check misses this.",pos

SAHEEN AHZAN A,5.0,A daily driver with some limitations!,"  I had to wait for long for this mobile as I was told that this is getting sold out very soon. And indeed it stands upto its reputation. To sum up, solid built quality, excellent display,  fast processor make it stands apart from its Chinese competitors. Don't Get fooled by its specs which say that it has polycarbonate body. Its rock solid chassis justifies its price. I'm not a gamer but I bought it for my mom.  So it's perfectly alright. The battery life reminds me of old ""Hero Honda "" ad of "" just fill it and forget it"" . The speaker is not that too loud but quality of music through headphones is very good especially when you switch on Dolby atmos. I used sennheiser px80 to test it. So please don't waste time and grab it.",pos

These phones are refurbished phones and not brand new phones which i didn't know and we cant return it as its not in the  policy, we can only replace them.

Himanshu S.,3.0,Screen protection,"  1. I put the phone on charging, but it ran into a boot loop for no reason. Then I opened in factory mode. But after choosing to restart, it would again go in boot loop. Then I choose safe mode. But it did not come back to normal mode despite many efforts and restarts. The only way to restart it in normal mode was to format it. So, I had to.With my experience in the first month, I knew the phone is not stable. Nor it is reliable. So configured important folders for auto backup on Onedrive so I won't lose important photos and Data again.2. The battery is ok, yet I think not 6000mah.

vikas,5.0,"I want a return and refund for this item, very disappointed with the display and  camera quality","  This phone is very much similar to Samsug M30s. Some few differences include 20 MP front camera and android 10 in M21. First I bought M30s four month before and now I bought M21 because the price was lower by 2000/- compare to M30s.The phone performs decently in almost all aspects except battery backup. The M21 is giving highly disappointing battery backup. Even though Samsung claims that it is a 6000 mAh battery, it won't last for more than One & half day with normal usage like phone calling, messaging, WA and some banking or office apps.My M30s with same 6000 mAh, was giving (I lost it and so I bought M21) me the battery backup of 3 to 4 days leisurely.If battery life matters for you, don't go for M21, instead buy M30s only.",neg

After 6 years of experience with Xiaomi we did lot of Research to change and chosen Samsung as preferred one.But am little disappointed with the performance here is pro's & cons.Pro's:1. Slim and very light to handle2. Audio output3. Lot of features inbuilt4. Battery backup ( comes 1&half day for moderate use)5. WiFi direct callingCons:1. >2 hrs charging time2. Doesn't feels like 48 megapixel & 20 megapixel front camera.3. Screen notifications are worst, you don't have screen led light blinking when any notifications come, so everytime you have to touch the screen to check for notifications.4.  Doesn't provide back case which competition does.5. Plastic back panel looks like ordinary phone for which you have to spend 16k.Overall not fully satisfied with this phone.

Mukesh malhotra,1.0,Solid built and  value for money,"  I love this phone and currently have no complaints regarding it. But I would love even more if its sound quality would be better. The only thing I hate about this phone is the plastic body which seems too brittle to break, but it's quite strong enough. Its 6000 mAh battery is too long-lasting and could easily give you a battery backup of 1.5 days. I even play games on it and it can easily handle COD mobile and PUBG mobile on medium settings. But if you want to play on high-end settings, I won't recommend this phone. I got this deal at 12699 and compared to the price I have paid, I am completely satisfied.

Charge once and use whole day.3. Camera Obviously  48 mp back camera and 20mp front will provide you amazing photography experience i am not good in clicking pictures. Hence i uploaded some of photos. I belive you can do better than me.4. It have 4GB RAM so you can do multitasking eseily. No lag while playing PUBG or COD whith high graphics setting.5.

Like it will track time spending on a single game, while playing if someone calling you will get very short popup to receive call or not.6. Again amazon sevice did great work even in lockdown. (5 out of 5).7. Manufacturing in india. And samsung relible brand.Cons.1. Charging time is too long even it have fast charging still you have to give 2hour to 2 hour 30 minute for full charging.2. I didnt like back side look but i still bought beacuse of feature and brand value and pricing.So overall my final rating is 4.7 out of 5. You should go for it.",neg
Ajay,5.0,Disappointment in Battery,"  I have been using this phone for the last one month and till now I did not see any technical defect in it.  This is Samsung's best budget phone so far.  I would like to give it a full 5 stars out of 5, with excellent emulated display, great processor, battery performance and camera quality.",neg
Mohit,4.0,"Hi,hope this helps","  Good product by SamsungBut I think samsung is also going the way of other cheap China mobiles by selling our data. Maybe to tackle the competition?First time when I switched on and starting updates I found other party apps like like videos ,Facebook and other unnecessary  apps started to get installed without my permission.But later these things have to be removed  settings tweaked to tackle the problem and it was really tough.Wasn't expecting this from samsung.(may be they thought that this is low end phone so why to worry?)Camera is good for its priceFingerprint reader and face recognition lock are useless in this price tag as you know if u mind or security as a basic",pos
Akashyamun,3.0,Fantastic go for it thanks,"  I bought this phone for my mother but used it for couple of weeks until I orderd Vivo z1x for myself. My mother is a casual gamer and plays light games. She also watches lots of videos and stream movies. And according to her needs I found this phone a perfect match at an unbelievable price (12699). I was looking for an amoled screen as it causes less strain on eyes.Display : Display is super awesome. Very bright and accurately colorful. I use Vivo z1x (Super amoled) and Samsung's display is far superior than of Vivo's. Daylight visibility is very good.Battery : Battery backup is excellent. It is easily giving 9 to 10 hours of screen on time. Charge it once and use it entire day without worry. Buttttt there is a major con, charging speed. It's 15w charger charges the phone very sluggishly. It takes almost 2 hours and 45 minuts to charge it fully.Camera : Camera performance is mediocre. It isn't great. Photos are good in daylight condition but things get bad in low light. Selfie Camara is also mediocre. Considering the price, Camara performance justifies the price.Sound : Speaker output is decently loud and clear. Headphone output is outstanding (because of Dolby atmos support).User interface : Phone runs on One UI android 10. It is majorly seamless with no lag. One UI is nice and feels premium. It has many customization options. There are no annoying ads or recommendations.Gaming : Phone performs excellent in light gaming. No major lag. Since my mother plays light games only, it serves the purpose well. Buttttt if you are a heavy gamer, please skip it without hesitation.Network : There is no issue in network or calling. Video streaming is also excellent. Good network reception.Cons :1. Sometimes finger print sensor is hit and miss. It annoys, you just keep rubbing your finger on the sensor and nothing happens.2. If you are a heavy user (who uses lots of games and apps) then phone will not feel smooth.3. Charging speed is very poor. In this fast lifestyle, it's very hard to manage with slow charging.4. Mediocre camera performance.5. Face unlock is bit slow and doesn't perform good in low light.Conclusion : I wanted to buy a phone for my mother and this phone fulfilled all the needs such as Amoled screen, big battery, decent processor, good sound output. Camera wasn't my priority. Overall very satisfied with the product.",pos

Sidhartha S.,5.0,Warrior without a Knife(fast charging👎),"  My own experience of 3 days:-Battery- not working good as expected 6000 mah,it's looks like 3500mah.Camera-this is pretty good ,image quality is good.Fingerprints-some times fails to read ir fingerprints otherwise it's good .Network- I'm facing network issues with this phone ,internet connection some time collapse,and also my relatives complaint that he can't able to call me,but I can call him(it's happening since 3 days when I insert my Vodafone 4g sim in my new phone....Otherwise performance is good.",pos
Cv Vineeth,4.0,Just ok product not as expected..,"  So I hv used it now for two days and here are my reviews:phone is big enough at this range. Performance is great. There is a dark mode avalable for all android system which I really liked. I am more into camera and I will rate this camera 4. There is too much exposure for photos. But night mode is too good. THis is perfect for low light imaging. But it will overexpose, so u will have to reduce the brightness. Also normal video will zoom a bit which I dont like. But u can shoot it in wide view as well which gives it a different feeling. The pro mode of camera for photos is less adjustable but it can overcome these limitations very well.The battery certainly lasted about 1.5 day on average usage with games, photos videos etc. At this price I think this is a v good deal.",pos
Ravi Kumar,3.0,Product is too good to buy without having any doubts regarding its features.,"  Regualr updates are required to boost system and software  performance.Camera is awesome rear and front.Functions are smooth and buttery .Watching movies and videos are very pleasant.But Some of the bloatware and third party apps  like Helo,likee,etc are yuck and must not be preinstalled. Thank God We can uninstall  them.Go for it .You wont regret except for regular android updates. only Feb month software update is provided so far by default. DONT KNOW if they provide regular security update or not.But it's  performance is by far smooth and well.While Doing DUO video call I felt heating of phone.Let's  see if it is improved in next security update.Samsung should provide headphones,back cover, tempered  glass with phones at their end.Regards,Edit:31may 2020Yesterday  took 30/40 photos and my phone Galaxy M21 appeared hot.Photos were quite good.What astonished me is this phone's  battery management .It generally takes three days to discharge.Actually I am a moderate user So It's expected but want the same performance in future. Samsung's own EXYNOS processor needs overhauling in comparison  to qualcom snapdragon and media  tech..Will add further information in due course02 june2020YouTube playback is sometimes stuck which I Experienced two three times.Software update is major issue.My preused samsung headphone is not compatible with its Jack.Loose .So doesn't works it ought  to be.My Nokia is much better than this phone is every aspect.Not a single time Hang or stuck during any usage.Samsung's  main problem is its processor which is required to be reengineered.In 30 july2020 got an update which was done  vastly. It feels good when the phone is updated regularly since it removes glitches and boosts performance.Samsung is listening its consumers I guess so it is providing updates.What I see in this update is battery is draining  a little faster than before.I am satisfied.Samsung should provide earphone, backcover and screen guard with every models I reiterate.Regards,My review is being altered.for some days  this phone has gone unexpectedly unresponsive. Touch is hectic and the display panel is heated .Samsung has provided me used phone by Amazon. I swear I will never buy  and persuade anyone to buy Samsung mobile ever.",neg

NEERAJ NIRANJAN,5.0,My 3 months experience,"  The Samsung M21 is a budget smartphone with professional features at a pocket friendly price. The smartphone has 48 MP camera that does justice to photos and videos. The phone has a dual sim which means it is like carrying two phones in one, without the need to lug two physical phones. The phone has VoLTE capability and supports the latest 4G SIM cards and protocols. The massive battery is a boon for those who need to keep on ""chatting/talking non-stop"". The fingerprint reader is located on the rear side and is extremely fast in responding to fingerprint recognition. It is a great buy at the given price. Go for it.",pos

While realme provides 5A charger that really fast charging.It has every features to say, but it is a low class product. Even not have an expected Samsung quality.",neg
Arunchunai,5.0,Good phone but ethics of Samsung has gone down,"  Yes.Cost efficiency is what i would call the super trait of M21 to be.This is the worthiest set to be bought at around ₹ 15k. Best Battery capacity and display (super AMOLED!) at this rate. Decent chipset.Been using it for a month. And it, indeed, is very good in overall performance and is more cost effective than I thought. In fact more cost effective than all the Mid Range phones I've bought so far.A massive 6000mAh Battery will sustain the phone for minimum a day but to be honest it does not deserve the hype it got. Also inclusion of a faster charger would have made me happier. But im still happy man!It Does heat up a little bit while charging. But seriously manages to keep the cool even while heavy RAM usage.The design is not appealing coming with a plastic body. This is a small negative which is overshadowed by the remaining overwhelming positives of M21.The april 2020 update is good. Trust me.If ever there is an offer where there is a rate drop below 14000 for a 4-64 variant then go for it.",neg
ROHITASHVA Dongre,5.0,Perfect phone for elder people.,  Display is the highlight. Best display on budget phone.Battery life is acceptable above 1 day of normal use. Charging takes much more time.Dont buy it for playing pubg. Battery heats up and after one hour very high frame drops and frequent restarting.Camera is way better than any other phones in the range. Skin tones and colour reproduction is somewhat natural.Overall good buy in the price range except for gaming.,pos

Amazon Customer,5.0,Not as expected phone😔😔,"  Just after 2 weeks of purchase, this Samsung M21 smartphone suddenly got hung and a portion of the screen is not responsiive. Immediately I  raised a complaint. The technical guy of customer care not even bothered to listen to the complaint. He just told that the return policy expired two days back, just two days and I dont even know about it. How can one expect that this kind of cheap goods being delivered to us. They can stop working at any time if they are too cheap. Amazon thinks the customers are like fools living in amazon forest. They should consider the complaint and need to respond in a constructive way. IN this pandemic matter of two days should be considered and extended.Apart from all these, the service is so bad and irresponsible. They are saying go to the samsung service centre. If we can go there why should one buy from your site? Because we believe better service from you irrespective of who the seller is. If its an offline purchase we should have checked every thing there itself physically. Since its Amazon we blindly ordered just by seeing images but later realized that it is also like ultra low grade e-marketing company after talking to this customer service guy. I just dont want to take his name. When I say how can we go out in this circumstances as ours is containment zone. He simply told not to order from amazon as they also cant deliver here. Amazon should seriously look into this guys behaviour. He is going to make you loose many customers.Finally, I suggest not to buy electronic products, particularly samsung brand from Amazon. Please go and buy offline. They are also suggesting the same indirectly.",neg
Tarvinder,3.0,Acceptable and V nice,"  Battery life is the main USP of this M series, camera quality is not upto expected but at this price range seeing the other specs the little camera quality can be compromised and if you can really want a good camera then go for M31 or M31s . samsung gives the best amoled display it's a no brainer. Fingerprint is very fast , face unlock is good but not at best but fingerprint unlock works really fast, phone runs smooth as well I'm not a gammer so don't know about that , there is little heating issue only while charging the phone , otherwise I haven't noticed heating issue, the phone comes with minimal blootware that's the best , it is not like any Chinese brands like MI , oppo , realme where you notice adds , so in this samsung one UI there is a near to a stock android experience without blootware and adds and that's very good as well",pos
ManisH,5.0,Samsung M21 Blue colour,  First I bought this phone as my old phone bricked and I needed one urgently. Only criteria was a not a made in china decently modern phone. This one a21 and 31 were trending in market though my research 6 months back wanted me to buy an a50 something these two had the same features CPU etc and processor but lesser ram and storage and one camera less and some megapixels lesser but who needs them anyway. All I need is one decent camera on each side.The camera in this is decent and has multiple modes and options like AR AI and wide angle and so on. Its confusing and I felt not in control. So sticking to 16:9 standard pics. Still the depth is pixelated even at 48 MP.The amoled screen is amazing in vivid colors though it can be quite hard on the eyes. I am keeping it in dark mode mostly and there is also a blue filter. There are also calm modes which put the phone in black and white and do not disturb mode for me time  away from phone.The phone is quite bulky by today's standards about a centimeter with a cover. It doesn't have 5g support either which many new phones bring.This is a mostly made in india phone with exception of charger cable from Vietnam and I am sure the processor and circuits made in Taiwan or china. Nevertheless it was refreshing to see a made in india phone designed by Samsung in a world where anything we buy is made in china. Though I must say the finish of the product and packing is not of such high quality as chineese brands like xiaomi vivo not even compare to one+. But the product itself is of higher quality than chineese phones.The cost is much higher than normal times perhaps due to pandemic or import curbs from china. Atleast 4k more. Such phones are in the 10k range but still feature to feature similar prized mi or others have more cameras and glass body and many more features. Brought this only cos of Made in India.but it has to become  competitive in terms of quality and price to be successful.Update: After a weeks use updating to 5 star. 3 day battery though no real fast charging takes 3 hrs to charge full. Performance is top notch no lag or hang and smooth even with extra animations enabled. Overall happy with the phone.,neg
Cv Vineeth,4.0,Issue with sd card and heating problem.,"  One of the best in market* sAMOLED 6.4 is delivering high satisfaction  Display is big, good, sharp, crisp and clear  enough, Bright colours.  one of the top reason  to go for M21*Dolby atmos gives amplified audio output* Battery is like ocean* Camera is Crystal Crisp* Fast enough* Best in budget* Video experience is just wowBut also know itBody is plastic but glossy , looks goodThe frame finishing does not give a luxurious feel. But a good cover can do that, anyways you will use a cover to protect it. So this reason should no stop you from getting M21.But when you use It, overall performance is going to be satisfying. 200 % recommend this mobile",pos
Ravi Kumar,3.0,this device battery not charging properley,"  I had been always buying budget phones from Chinese brands for my Parents until now. Then I heard about the new Samsung M Series range of phones making sensation in the market with Super AMOLED screen and good configurations for the price. Decided to give it a try this time and ordered the M21 for my dad. Upon receiving the phone, I was blown away by the almost everything this phone was offering in this price range. The screen quality is amazing with definite 2 days battery life. The performance of the phone is more than adequate and easily compares to any other sub 15k phones, but the camera quality, battery and the screen quality surpasses almost all others in this segment. The screen quality is better than even my twice expensive phone which is having IPS TFT panel.Pros:Great screenCamera qualityBattery backupPerformanceSoftware refinementCons:Weight. But its justifying given the massive battery size.Plastic Body. But to be frank, we use phones with cases. So in that case, plastic body is safer than glass. So not a con actually.No bundled earphones. That too can't be really complained in this price range and also currently, no one is supplying the same.Verdict:I am loving it more and my dad is also happy since its a Korean and non Chinese brand and Proudly Made in India phone. This purchase made me order an M31 for my mother the next day, since she is really keen on phone camera quality than my dad, and since this 13k phone amazing for its camera, was having even high hopes for an 18k phone which is having higher camera specs.",pos

Does a good job for a noob photographer like meCons1. Charging wire could have been little longer2. I miss led notification lightOver all Samsung has done a very good job in mid range segment.

Jagannath,5.0,Monstrous Cost Efficiency,"  Overall the phone is excellent at this price point.  You cannot go wrong with it.The pros1) Superb 6.3"" display with SuperAMOLED : This is really great to have. There are many higher end phones which are pricier, but every time you view on your phone the display is something that goes beyond its segment2) Awesome battery: I believe this is something very important far more than only performance.  Can be a life saver during the occasional instance when you have forgotten to charge it.  Till now  with most never dropped below 30% charge.  Have a reserve charge is good.Also:  The 15W fast charger is fast enough unlike what people believe.  Just don't wait to charge it until its fully discharged.3) One UI on Android 10 and processor performance: Samsuns's OneUI is decent and consistent now across devices. It looks modern and works without lags. Ofcourse its not a gamer or performance phone. But the Exynos 9611 processor is good enough for most tasks for most people.  Also I am sure Samsung will update to Android 11 and maybe even 12.4) Sales and Service: Not much direct experience, but I see that the service center availability is so much better than my previous phone (ASUS Zenfone)5) Signal Reception and SAR: Having a low SAR value is important . WIFi and call reception is excellent. Speaker is loud and clear.Cons:If I have to pick one con for this phone, its the camera. Its average - if I compare it to the ASUS Zenfone 3, a older phone - but then ASUS specializes in the camera area.So camera is average just like most phones at this price point .",neg

fashid,4.0,"Bad Processor, gets hot, hanged a lot, don't  play videos properly. It should  be priced 10000","  Performance of the phone is good so far. The finger print scanner is is indeed very fast but the best thing I like about this phone is its super amoled display; it is a treat to watch videos on this phone. Camera I personally don't use much, but the quality of front and rear cameras is pretty good especially the night mode which is very helpful in taking pics in low light.Looks good in hand and it is very lightweight which is an added advantage. Now the storage of 128 GB of which 100 gb is at your disposal which practically eliminates the need for external storage for an average user like me. Sound quality is also good and you can listen to your favourite music anytime.The only drawback is battery which as mentioned 6000mAh doesn't seems to be working as long as it should. It still manages to get 36 hours of usage after full charge which takes almost 2 hours with the fast charging feature.Overall considering the price range it is a very good phone with all the necessary features packed in a compact and lightweight device for the average user.",pos
sreejith s ampady,4.0,The most useless and least productive response from Amazon customer care,"  Just purchased this phone as i had no other option as i dont support chinese product anymore.The picture quality of the phone is great but the phone starts hanging while using whatsapp. Even after using it for 15min the phone becomes heated . To disconnet the call you need to tap twice on the cancel  button.I had used Samasung Galaxy J7 few years back and it was my worst experience ever. I thought Samsung being such a big company might have improved the quality after years. But i was wrong.Strong suggestion to buyers....Never go for Samsung , keep it as a last option to buy.",neg
Preet Masih,4.0,Good budget Phone with a mega battery life,"  Purchased Galaxy M21 for sister as it is non-Chinese. But now I am regretting not buying other brand. Such pathetic M series was not expected from Samsung.Only gud thing abt this phone is Amoled display, large battery and decent camera.Rest everything is impractical...be it1. Plastic back- plastic back is finger print magnate and will get scratches easily.2.Rear fingerprint placement- fingerprint position is so upward that literally u need to find it . Also it is so flat with back body making diffictly in distinguishing fingerprint sensor with back body.3. Slow Processor- processor is slow/laggy. Phone started getting slow from 1st day of usage. Slow opening of app or buffering type slow response which irritates a lot.4. Heating issue- Most pathetic thing abt this phone is its heating issue. Means it will heat more at earpiece area only(upper part of phone). I have used other phones also...but samsung makes record among all in term of heating issue.5. No screen protector and phone cover- Many brands which are much cheaper than Samsung and gives equal quality at low price, include screen protector and phone cover but I don't know why Samsung is doing this. Now I will have to buy it separately.Overall I am disappointed with Samsung mid range phones as they are not made for practical purpose. It will not be wrong to say why brands like Mi, realmse got big boom over Samsung. They provide every practical need which we want.Sorry samsung but this will be my last purchase of samsung phone.",neg

Sanjeev,1.0,Best budget phone in this price range without a doubt,"  Do you want an android phone?Do you've a higher perceived brand value for Samsung?Is your budget under INR 13K?If your answer for all of these is YES, then do not wait, just buy it !*** The Processor Debate ***This Snapdragon Vs. Exonys Vs. Mediatek etc, this is all just topics of debate for youtubers. They need content for their channels, don't put your mind in tizzy unless you are a heavy gamer and your life depends on nano-seconds of lag.Yes all these processor debate end at the difference of nano seconds which in real life is even way beyond blink and miss. You can't notice it even if you are Rajnikant. So chose a phone which is VFM for you.*** Perceived Brand Value of Samsung ***Lets just put it out here, Samsung is the Apple of Android world. Right or wrong ? 100% Right !!For me, i always recommended Xiaomi phones to folks who want innovation on a budget. But if you want and Apple but one running Android then Samsung is best bet for you.*** Durability ***Samsung phones are durable and so are even MI phones. I have one Mi A1 still working in mint condition used by my mother. So your decision making should be based on the brand value doe you.*** Battery ***One thing Samsung has learnt for its entry level and mid level offerings is to rightly capture the need. People need large capacity batteries because mobile phone has become one of our limbs, extension of our body part.Added benifit : decent camera , 3.5 mm jack.*** To Summarize ***If you do not want a Xiaomi or Real Me or Moto because you want a SAMSUNG, then go for it, because**** it has massive juice to last**** oh you've a SAMSUNG*** take those 🤳 selfiesTo suarize",neg
Cv Vineeth,4.0,Its like jewel in your hand.,"  I have been using a smaller 5"" form factor phone for almost 3-4 years. Had been wanting to buy my next phone for quite some time and finally bought this one.And I would say I'm content with the it.It has a vibrant display best in class I would say. I don't notice the U notch for sometime of usage.Good speaker not something loud but good enough.Good cameras for the price! Some might find the selfie camera less impressive but its good enough for social media needs.Excellent battery! Better than all those 1000$ phones! 😁And the performance is fine enough for me, I get some lags here an there but nothing which makes trouble in my daily tasks. I would say the performance is same as compared to my old phone S6 Edge, which is good as it still runs smoothly! 😁 Btw, I don't game much!!Perfect to gift it to your mom, dad or anyone in your family. It has good big fonts. And no bogus softwares you might see in other brands!I would say I made a right decision to not invest in a premium phone and saved a lot of money.

Ravi Kumar,3.0,A fantastic arrival in Mid range segment,"  Pathetic phone. It cannot be called a phone because it does not do what a phone is supposed to do - make calls. It keeps getting disconnected everytime you're on a call. The network reception is also pathetic, it cannot receive signal from a tower far away. Every time it gets automatically disconnected the phone cannot connect to the carrier and you have to wait for half hour to make another call. If it seems too good to be true then it is too good to be true. I bought the phone for my mum thinking it has a good battery but what's the point of having a good battery and not being able to make calls?!EDIT: An update fixed almost all the issues for now. We'll see how long it lasts.",neg

Aravind N.,1.0,Excellent product Made in India!,"  Phone  m21 6Gb delivered on 17 June, it was good suddently from 13 July the phone charging slot started heating up.Now the phone is not charging at all. It only charges when connected to laptop or PC but some thing starts melting.Some thing have been burnt inside.And the Faulty replace is just for 10 Day form Purchase.Samsung India is answerable for this, this shows the level of QA is done by Samsung IndiaRecommendation : Do not purchase this phone. This is second faulty product in last 7 years. I wasted my money investing on it.",pos
Prabhat Visvakarma,5.0,Very good device,"  I had purchased Samsung Galaxy M21 6GB RAM 128 GB on 3rd July. Model is good, sAmoled display good. Battery performance best. Fast Charging good. But the processor not good for gaming. I have installed Asphalt 8 car game, mobile is lagging sometime evenI have 6GB RAM model. You can use mobile for all things except Gaming. I hope Samsung will think on it and changed their mobile processor.",pos

404 ERROR PAGE NOT FOUND,4.0,Perfect phone by Samsung.♥️♥️,"  Its a shame that a phone with such great hardware does not have a competing software to complement it. Its one ui2 is inferior to MIUI found on MI/xiaomi phones IMO. If you're used to MIUI like me then some may be disapointed on software front:-pros:-battery life,camera,fast charger,excellent displaycons:-# no usb 3.1 gen2# no bluetooth 5.1 only(5.0)# no wifi 6 supportsoftware(UI) issues# missing call record option during the call.# missing native app lock feature. This is a big one as third party apps are very poor and MIUI version is great. Samsungs 'S Secure' is a breather but not as good as MI's app lock. you have to unlock each app individually in s secure and install it separately.# if you hide text message content on lock screen it gets hidden when you're logged in as well.# No messages feature which can't detect OTP's in messages.# poor file manager compared to MI and google# no support for showing network speed in status bar# no ability to set daily data limits only monthly limits can be set.# very basic messages app compared to MIUI version# more bloatware and app control than MIUI, can'e even uninstall facebook(only disable).# can't limit the number of connected devices via hotspot.# even taking screenshots is more intuitive and fast in MIUI where you just swipe three fingers down the screen or use the button in notification panel. Samsung uses yet another app for screenshots to which you have to grant permission to save the screenshot although you do not have to install it separately.Most of software limitations can be overcome by installing third party or samsung's own apps. But they will slow the phone down as native(OS) implementations are much faster. Also most of these are small usability tweaks which should not take too much efforts to implement but they will improve the user perception of their phones because many people will install apps for these features and slow their phones down and then blame samsung for building slow phones. Hope samsung is listening to this for their own sake.",neg
